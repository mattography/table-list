## Synopsis

Table List is an experiment using Firebase, Twilio (for sending text messages) and Zapier (to automate messages from Firebase to Twilio) that would allow a restaurant to track customers and send notifications when their reservation is available.

**Due to Zapier's recent lack of support for Firebase, automation of text messages being sent is no longer available, without a NodeJS server constantly running**
